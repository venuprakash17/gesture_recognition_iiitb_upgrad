# Gesture Recognition: Case study IIITB & Upgrad
Recognising 5 different hand gestures to control a smart TV

In order to enable people manage the TV without a remote, we need to design a cool function in the smart TV that can recognize five various gestures made by the user. 


The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:
 - Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
 - Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
 - Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
 - Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
 - Stop: Pause the movie
 
A few hundred videos that have been categorized into one of the five classes make up the training data. Every video, which lasts for two to three seconds on average, is composed of thirty frames, or images. These films were captured by different individuals using a webcam—the same kind that the smart TV would use—while making one of the five gestures.
